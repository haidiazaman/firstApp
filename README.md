| Area         | Task                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Backend**  | Build FastAPI app to load ML model and expose a `/predict` endpoint            |
| **Model**    | Load a pre-trained cat vs dog classifier (e.g. simple CNN or fine-tuned model) |
| **Frontend** | Build Streamlit UI for image upload + display prediction                       |
| **Deploy**   | Deploy: FastAPI on **Render**, Streamlit on **Streamlit Community Cloud**      |
| **Connect**  | Use `requests` in Streamlit to call FastAPI API                                |
| **Extras**   | (Optional) Add a database to log predictions or uploaded images later          |

- Backend Deployment on Render
    1. Train a ml model -> export pickle file
    2. Create a fastapi app
    3. Run locally
    4. Push code to Github
    5. Deploy on render
